This is the WoC client for Vim.

http://dev.dyne.org/trac.cgi/wiki/Woc

*** Browsing

Read the initial comment of woc.vim. You'll find the description of the
commands and mappings defined by woc.vim.

For a tutorial on WoC, try the demo: demo/README


*** Publishing

If you want to add WoC support in your online texts/sources you have several
options:

	* just include the tags files (tags, cscope.out, ...) in your online
	  repository. This option is valid only if you aren't using generic 
	  WoC tags (one like {-this-}).

	* use the  woctags.sh  script to generate .woc/ (as suggested by the
	  woc protocol) and tags.woc, tags.rev.woc. Include all this files in
	  your online repository.

Note: If the index.woc has been used, then it must be included in the online 
      repository, because the aliases defined in it, will be loaded by the WoC 
      clients when reading the online texts.

The usage of woctags.sh is simple:

	woctags [dir|files] [options to 'find']

	Note:  By default, 'find' searches recursively the current
		directory. To disable this behaviour use -maxdepth 1

Examples:
	
	# Parse everything in the current directory, except the tags files.
	# Generate .woc/, tags.woc and tags.rev.woc
	./woctags.sh

	# Generate the WoC tags file, parsing only C sources present in the
	# current directory and in all the subdirs
	./woctags.sh ./ -name *.[ch]
	
	# The same of above, but limiting the search in the current directory,
	# i.e without descending on any subdir
	./woctags.sh ./ -name *.[ch] -maxdepth 1
