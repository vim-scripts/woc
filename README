If you don't know what WoC is, read http://dev.dyne.org/wiki/Woc .

Short description:
This plugin permits to use "hypertags", i.e. tags pointing to remote files. 
It also supports cscope and ctags, thus you can use hyper-cscope commands which will bring you to remote locations.

General description:
Wocvim is a WoC client for Vim. WoC is a protocol which enables the use of hyperlinks in plain ASCII texts. 
The links can point to local or remote locations. The protocol is specifically designed to support source code, but it can
be used in any text. For source code, it's also possible to use ad-hoc tag generators like cscope and ctags.
